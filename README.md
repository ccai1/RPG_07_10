# RPG_7_10
APCS Project with Holmes

The combat system is really awful. And what is all those seeming old English stuff? 
Created a more RPG-like interface in Main();

idk how video games work so i randomly added field values 
just change some of the numbers around

most of the changes are on the protagonist_subclasses branch BTW

General Protagonist toString(?) format:

Hello, ?. You are a (class name).

General Monster toString format:

This is a (Monster type) named (Monster name).
